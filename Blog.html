                    <p class="p-summary">-Summary</p>
                    <p>
                     What is hypertext? Our most respected scholars offer answers that span a wide range. In the literary community, the definitions offered often focus on the link. A number of well-known hypertext researchers from the University of Southampton argue link-based understandings miss "some of the more profound aspects of hypertext". Intellectual communities must be home to arguments over the definitions of key terms, as these are arguments about the meaning of the field.
 
                     But they must also be able to understand the history of our terms, so that we can see how competing definitions of the moment are movements in different directions from a common starting point. In the case of "hypertext" the term was coined by Theodor Holm ("Ted") Nelson. This paper examines two of Nelson's early publications of the term in order to provide a starting point for historically-informed definitions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-name">-Reflection</p>
                    <p>
                     According to Nelson's 1965 paper “A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate” a "hyperfilm" is a browsable or variable-sequenced film, not just another type of "hypertext". He defines hypertext as a body of written and pictorial content interconnected in such a complicated way that it cannot be expressed or depicted on paper in the same phrase. Two paragraphs later, he describes hyperfilm as "only one of the possible hypermedia that require our attention". Nelson's definition does not explicitly contradict definitions of hypertext that focus on the link, links are not mentioned. Both hypertext and hyperfilm are characterized as “new media”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In his 1970 “No More Teachers’ Dirty Looks” Nelson says Hyper-media are branching or acting displays that respond to user inputs, such as systems of pre-arranged words and pictures that can be explored freely or queried in stylized ways. Authors, artists, designers, and editors will design, write, draw, and edit them, rather than having them "programmed." They will be media, just like conventional writing and pictures, and because they are "multi-dimensional" in some way, we might name them hyper-media, based on the mathematics term "hyper-."
 
                     Nelson goes on to give examples of other sorts of hyper-media under the category "Discrete Hypertexts," the first of them can be found. "'Hypertext' refers to kinds of writing that branch or execute on demand; it's best displayed on computer displays," Nelson explains. Hypertexts that are discrete, or chunk style, are made up of individual bits of text that are linked together." In the text, the term "link" appears for the first time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     What I understand Hypertext to be is a method of linking and accessing multiple types of information as a web of nodes that the user can traverse at their leisure. It's worth noting that Nelson defined hypertext as "types of writing that branch or act on demand." Discrete hypertext relies on links to allow for branching on demand. Instead of using links, Stretchtext creates a non-branching performance. More categories of HyperMedia are listed such as “hypergram” (“a performing or branching picture”), “hypermap” (a smooth zooming interface) and “queriable illustrations” (a type of hypergram). While the behaviors of discrete hypertext and stretchtext differ significantly, they are both "forms of writing." While the examples of hypergrams, hypermaps, and queriable illustrations all involve text, discrete hypertext and stretchtext, in their manner of operation, are textual, that is, writing (even if they include pictorial material).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The reading concludes by welcoming the different meanings of hypertext stating that a definition of hypertext must be followed with context. Individuals in the literary community must review hypertext definitions that emphasize the link, and those in hypertext research must examine definitions that prioritize knowledge work over media.

                 <strong class="p-name">What is a browser? How do they work?</strong>
                 <p>
                     "An internet browser, also known as a web browser or simply a browser, is a software program that lets you view web pages on your computer." (Sandra Grauschopf,2022). In more specific terms, a browser is a software application that is used to search, retrieve, and display information from the World Wide Web. The information can be in the form of images, web pages, videos, and other files that are connected via hyperlinks and classified using URLs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Examples of the most common browsers include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer, just to name a few.
                 </p>
                   <p>
                     The following is a brief history of web browsers:  
                   </p>
                   <li>
                      In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, created the first browser called World Wide Web, which was subsequently renamed Nexus to avoid confusion with the actual World Wide Web. It was a rudimentary, text-based platform with a tiny audience since it was nearly unreachable to anyone who did not have technological skills
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      Mosaic, the first Web browser with a graphical user interface, was introduced in 1993.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       The Mosaic team simultaneously created Netscape Navigator, which was meant for residential customers to surf at dial-up modem speeds. Following its first release in 1994, Netscape Navigator soon became the dominant Web browser
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Opera was the subject of a research project that began in 1994. Later, in 1996, it was made public.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Safari, Apple's browser, was released in 2003. It was designed exclusively for Macintosh computers.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Mozilla launched Firefox as Netscape Navigator in 2004.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Mobile Safari was introduced in 2007 as an Apple mobile web browser.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       Google Chrome, the popular browser, was released in 2008.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       In 2011, the fast-growing mobile-based browser Opera Mini was introduced.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       And in 2015, Microsoft released the Edge browser.
                   </li>
                   <p>
                     Early web browsers, such as Mosaic and Netscape Navigator, were basic software that displayed HTML, handled form input, and provided bookmark support. Web browser requirements have grown in tandem with the evolution of websites. Browsers nowadays are significantly more sophisticated, supporting numerous forms of HTML (such as XHTML and HTML 5), dynamic JavaScript, and the encryption used by secure websites. Web developers can build highly interactive websites thanks to the capabilities of modern web browsers.
                   </p>
                   <strong>How do they work?</strong>
                   <p> 
                     "The primary function of a web browser is to render HTML, the code used to design or "mark up" webpages." (TechTerms.com, 2014). Web browsers operate in a client/server framework. The client is the browser that runs on the user's device and sends requests to the Web server, whereas the server is the Web server that provides information back to the browser. The browser then analyzes and displays the information on the user's device. When a user types a web address or URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into a search box, such as facebook.com, the request is forwarded to domain name servers (DNS). Several routers and switches are used to route all of these requests. A list of system names and their IP addresses is kept on the domain name servers. As a result, when you write something in the browser search box, it is turned into a number that decides which machines will see the search results. In the client-server architecture, the browser plays a role. A browser is a client application that uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to deliver requests to the server in response to user search queries. When the server gets the request, it gathers information about the requested content and returns it to the browser. The browser then translates and shows the information on the user's device. To put it in simple terms, a browser connects with a web server using the HTTP protocol, which requests an HTML file. also, which will be interpreted by the browser and shown on the user's device's screen.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     Web browsers are typically composed of a number of interconnected components. The user interface (UI), which is the level at which the user interacts with the browser, is included. The browser engine is responsible for querying the rendering engine, and the rendering engine is responsible for producing the requested web page—interpreting the HTML or XML documents. Internet security and communication are handled through networking. A JavaScript interpreter is used on a website to interpret and execute JavaScript code. The UI backend is responsible for the creation of widgets such as windows. A persistence layer, also known as data persistence or storage, controls data such as bookmarks, caches, and cookies.

                  <p>
                   <strong class="p-name">What is Metadata?</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Metadata is a summary and description of your data that is used to classify, organize, label, and interpret data, making sorting and searching for data much easier. Companies cannot handle the massive volumes of data generated and gathered throughout a business without it. They require it in order to comprehend and efficiently deploy information resources to support various business operations and to allow sophisticated analytics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Metadata is behind-the-scenes information that is utilized everywhere, by every sector, and in a variety of ways. It is widely used in computer systems, social media, websites, software, music services, and online shopping. Metadata can be created manually by selecting what should be included, or it can be generated automatically depending on the data. There are many types of metadata which includes:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Descriptive metadata is information about a resource or a file that is described in detail. It is used to aid in the detection and identification of objects. Title, abstract, author, and keywords are examples of descriptive metadata.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Structural metadata: information on the structure of a data entity. It informs users about the organization of a resource or file. A table of contents is an example of structural metadata. Tables of contents show how pages from different chapters are connected to one another.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Administrative metadata: Technical data that aids in the management of a resource. This might be the date the file was created, the file type, the permissions, and so on. Administrative metadata is also linked to use rights and intellectual property, since it provides information such as who owns a certain item, how it can be used, by whom, and for how long.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Until the 1980s, when libraries transferred their catalog data to digital databases, metadata was employed in library card catalogs. As data and information were increasingly saved digitally in the 2000s, this digital material was characterized using metadata standards. Different disciplines have their own metadata standards (e.g., museum collections, digital audio files, websites, etc.). Describing the contents and context of data or data files improves their use. A web page, for example, may have metadata indicating what software language the page was written in (e.g., HTML), what tools were used to generate it, what subjects the page is about, and where further information about the subject can be found. This metadata can improve the reader's experience and make it simpler for users to discover the web page online.
                  </p>
                  <strong class="p-name">Why is metadata important?</strong>
                  <p>
                   Metadata makes it easier to find important information as well as search for and retrieve resources. Any digital asset that has been tagged with metadata may be automatically connected with other relevant pieces, making it easier to organize and discover. This allows consumers to establish connections that they would not have made otherwise.
                   Metadata are used to assist and promote resource discovery, identification, resource organization, and the exchangeability of the data as well as the resource or resources it represents. Because not all resources are self-descriptive, metadata captures and provides vital contextual facts.
                   
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Data is nothing more than the sum of its metadata. It is what enables us to build a full picture of our data and comprehend it in its entirety. Because metadata is not the real data, it may normally be made public without risk because it does not offer anybody access to the raw data. Knowing summary facts about a web page or video file, for example, is sufficient to grasp what the file is but insufficient to see the entire page or play the entire video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Metadata on web pages may be quite useful. The metadata includes content descriptions as well as keywords related to the material. Because search engines frequently display this metadata in search results, its correctness and details may impact whether or not a user decides to visit a site. This data is often given in the form of meta tags.
                  </p>
                  <strong class="p-name">How does it work?</strong>
                  <p>
                   When a document, file, or other information asset is updated, including deletion, metadata is produced. Accurate metadata may help extend the life of current data by assisting users in finding new applications for it. Metadata organizes a data object by employing phrases that are connected with that thing. It also allows different things to be detected and linked with comparable objects to assist maximize the utilization of data assets. As previously stated, search engines and browsers decide which online content to show by parsing the metadata tags associated with an HTML document.

                     I would like to believe that my first website was fun to make. The concepts discussed were not too foreign to understand because I could follow the logic and practice of web design. The year before, I was doing coding, so I would say having prior knowledge of coding made the experience a bit easier. However, starting something new comes with its challenges. I believe as time goes on, I will improve in my web designing. The visual aspect of things needs to be improved. It looks basic and doesn’t have the artistic appeal of the websites I was using for inspiration.

                   <p>
                     What I like about this is the use of color and the logo. It's not too much. It makes the user engage with the website even more. I am not too harsh on myself. I know, with time and practice, I can improve my visual communication. Overall, the experience has been kind to me. I understood the logic and practice of web design. I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I’m excited to get started.

              <div class="e-content">
                <p>A close reading of Graham et al’s "Toward a study of information geographies".</p>
                <p>Summary</p>
                <p>The article seeks to understand how information is distributed across the world. The study examines the factors and contributors of information distribution in the internet era. "Information has always had geography. It is from somewhere; about somewhere; it evolves and is transformed somewhere; it is mediated by networks, infrastructures, and technologies, all of which exist in physical, material places. " (Graham et al., 2015). In summary, information originates from, engages with, and is adapted to a variety of local contexts and geographies, ranging from conventional measures to instruction manuals to myths and legends. This essay explores a variety of contemporary information geographies to gain access to patterns of mutability, mobility, and underlying power dynamics in connection to historical arrangements in the production and use of information.</p>
                <p>Critical reflection</p>
                <p>What is Information Geography?</p>
                <p>Information is defined as "knowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction" (Merriam-Webster, 2022) and geography as "Geography is the study of places and the relationships between people and their environments." (National Geographic, 2022). So, therefore, information geography is knowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction of places and the relationships between people and their environments.</p>
                <p>Aims</p>
                <p>This article examines major geographies of access, participation, and representation by combining current statistics with previously unmapped or analyzed data. The aim is to understand how information geography is distributed, accessed, represented, and used across the world.</p>
                <p>Methodology</p>
                <p>The method was to divide information geography into three categories: geographies of access and enablement; geographies of participation; and geographies of representation. Within each of these categories, we create a set of mappings based on the most authoritative sources. Some statistics originate from well-known sources (such as the International Telecommunications Union), which give useful indications of information consumption (as a result, these data have been fairly widely disseminated). In contrast, much of the data utilized in this article were collected using specialized data collecting technologies and are narrowly focused on the geography of a single type of information (and therefore rarely, if ever, used previously).</p>
                <p>Results</p>
                <p>Geographies of access and enablement</p>
                <p>Tool(s): Internet users and broadband affordability</p>
                <p>Outcome:</p>
                <p>1.	Internet users</p>
                <p>With almost half a billion internet users, China has the world's largest online population, followed by the United States, India, and Japan as the next most populated nations with internet users. First, Asia has emerged as the greatest component of the world's online population, accounting for 42 percent of all internet users, which implies that the combination of China, India, and Japan has more internet users than Europe and North America combined. Second, only a few countries with a significant number of users are in the top quintile (80+ percent) of internet penetration, while others, such as India, are in the bottom quintile, with fewer than 20% of their population using the internet.</p>
                <p>2.	Broadband affordability</p>
                <p>In most regions of Africa, the cost of a broadband connection is prohibitively expensive for most individuals, with costs ranging from 10% to 250% of the average income. On the other hand, North and South American and European customers, on the other hand, may get broadband connections for less than (and frequently considerably less than) 10% of their income, a distinction shared by just five Sub-Saharan African nations.</p>
                <p>Geographies of participation</p>
                <p>Tool(s): Domains, Github, and Wikipedia</p>
                <p>Outcome:</p>
                <p>1.	Domain</p>
                <p>The majority of domains (78 percent) are registered in Europe or North America, highlighting the dominance of those two countries in terms of online content production. In comparison, Asia has only 13 percent of the world's domains, while Latin America (5 percent), Oceania (3 percent), and the Middle East and Africa together (2 percent) have even lower percentages.</p>
                <p>2.	Github</p>
                <p>For Github, North America and Europe account for more than one-third of total GitHub users, and the rates of participation, 34 and 21 GitHub users per 100 000 internet users (hereafter referred to as G per 100 K), respectively, contrast with the global average of 11.4G per 100 K, albeit less dramatically than seen with domain names.
                  <br><br>The platform is most popular in Northern and Eastern Europe, Iceland, and Sweden, which each have more than 50G per 100K, as well as New Zealand and Australia, which have over 35G per 100K. Singapore (27G per 100 K) and Taiwan (10G per 100 K) account for the majority of the remaining third (17 percent of total GitHub users).
                  </p>
                <p>3.	Wikipedia</p>
                <p>Each quarter, over a million edits are made by users in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. In comparison, much of Africa and the Middle East report barely a few thousand edits every quarter. Furthermore, Users in the United States and the United Kingdom provide 85 percent and 78 percent of content concerning the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively; the figures in Africa are substantially lower. Locals contribute just 16 percent of Nigerian content and 9 percent of Kenyan content, while throughout much of the rest of the continent, less than 5 percent of content is generated locally.</p>
                <p>Geographies of representation</p>
                <p>Tool(s): Google searches, OpenStreetMap and Semantic Web</p>
                <p>Outcome:</p>
                <p>1.	Google searches</p>
                <p>In Google's index, the United States has the most total mentions, followed by Japan, China, and the United Kingdom. Chad has the most database entries per internet user, excluding micro-states and small island nations (with over 400 per user).</p>
                <p>2.	OpenStreetMap</p>
                <p>The United States has the most overall content, holding 21% of all nodes in OSM, followed by France, Canada, Germany, and Russia, all of which have more than 100 million nodes. These five countries alone account for 58% of all OSM content, and the group of high-income OECD countries accounts for roughly 80% of nodes. The Netherlands has the highest content density, with over 1000 nodes per square kilometer on average, followed by Belgium, which has over 700 nodes per square kilometer. There are around 400 nodes per square kilometer in Germany, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and France. In comparison to Europe, the southern hemisphere is significantly less thinly covered. Africa and Latin America each account for less than 5% of the world's material in OSM. In comparison, California alone accounts for nearly as much material as the whole continent of Africa, while Iceland, although being a tenth of the area and having half the population, It contains as much content as Egypt.</p>
                <p>3.	Semantic Web</p>
                <p>The United States has the highest concentration in Freebase – 45 percent of placenames – despite having less than 5% of the world's population and 10% of internet users. As a result, the average number of Freebase entries in the United States — one for every 1500 people — far outnumbers the rest of the world.A third of all Freebase place names are in Europe, with the United Kingdom accounting for 7%, Poland accounting for 6%, and France accounting for little more than 5%. The majority of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean are also underrepresented. Nigeria, for example, has fewer than 0.1 percent of the place names in the dataset but has 2.5 percent of the world's population.
                  <br><br>The United States accounts for 25% (rather than 45%) of the total database. Although less concentrated, there is still more material about the United States than all of Asia, which has just 23% of the placenames, or Europe, which has 19% of the placenames. India is by far the most underrepresented country in the world, accounting for only 0.6 percent of the collection.
                  </p>
                <p>Reflect critically on their conclusions.</p>
                <p>Information has always been spatial in nature. It is made someplace, it is utilized elsewhere, and it travels between locations (Graham et al., 2015). And information geography has always been entangled with power dynamics. Certain people have significantly more influence than others, and some locations are vital in information ecosystems while others are peripheral.
                  <br><br>Many, however, have turned to the internet as a means of overcoming some of these old limits. In principle, access to the internet allows users to access the sum total of all codified human knowledge; it allows everyone to compete on a more equal playing field. This is due to the fact that there are minimal geographical barriers to information transmission through the internet. With a few exceptions (particularly China and a few other totalitarian countries), content such as a Wikipedia entry or a Google Book is available to anybody on the planet. However, it is important to recognize that the internet, and the information contained within it, are also characterized by actual spatial disparities. The vast majority of people have never used the internet, and certain parts of the world have very little representation in our digital world.
                  </p>
                <p>Suggest avenues for future research.</p>
                <p>The Internet is a significant new medium for trade in a variety of sectors. While the potential presented by this phenomenon is obvious, there is still much debate and conjecture about how the usage of the Internet, namely the World Wide Web, will affect existing sectors. For research purposes, we need to know how technological developments affect existing sectors of the economy, especially in 3rd world countries. I think this research would better explain why Africa is left behind in the digital technological advancements.</p>

                <p>Critical Writing - Critical Analysis of your own UX and UI</p>
                <p>The premise of today’s writing is to analyze and give a report on my website’s user interface and user experience. This will be hard to discuss because I am the designer, not a user, but with the aid of readings and examples from websites I think have good UI and UX, this should be an accurate analysis.
                  <br><br>Firstly, what constitutes a good UI & UX?<br><br>
                  •	Information architecture: the art and science of arranging and labeling websites, intranets, online communities, and software to improve usability and findability; and a burgeoning community of practice dedicated on integrating design, architecture, and information science concepts to the digital realm. “The goal is to help users find information and complete tasks.” (Goldberg, 2022).
                  <br>•	CALL TO ACTION: “it's the part of a story, webpage, advertisement, or piece of content that encourages the audience to do something.” (Goldberg, 2022). This is the feature that the user interacts with the most. It’s the red buttom that draws the user’s attention.
                  <br>•	READABILITY AND LEGABILITY: how well information is arranged.
                  <br>•	VISUAL WEIGHT: how well content is placed on your website. 
                  <br>•	BALANCE AND ALIGNMENT: how well proportions and placement are used.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <img src="Screenshot (7).png" class="image"><class="u-photo"></class>
                    
                    <p class="caption">Figure 1.1 Screenshot of my website</p>
                  
                  </p>
                  <p>This is how my website looks currently. The information architecture is designed for the user to be able to interchange from one web page to another by clicking the three hyperlinks (buttons): Home, Portfolio, and Profile. Furthermore, the user needs to scroll up and down to access more information. This could be improved. When the user first opens the website, they are confronted with information with no special headings that will guide their eyes. This is referred to as "hierarchy" and it "directly relates to how well content can be processed by people using a platform. It refers to the importance of elements within a design."  (Goldberg, 2022). The first thing that I could do to fix this is make it big and center it. This ties perfectly with readability and legability. Using edge alignment isn’t working too well here. Hopefully, implementing center aliment will improve with regard to readability and legability. Moreover, choosing a good color scheme that is visually appealing is a priority as we know that "some colors are perceived as weighing more than others." (Goldberg, 2022). So, choosing a scheme that visually weighs less is the key for this website. Images need to be cantered and given the right proportion according to their hierarchy. This could be archived with radial balance.
                    <br><br>Finally, call to action I am particularly happy with my [hyperlink] buttons' placement as it follows website conventions, so it shouldn’t be hard for users to figure out how to use them. One thing I could do is make them glow a certain color when the user hovers over them.

                <p>Critical Writing: Internet, Society and Design Justice</p>
                <p>Internet</p>
                <p>The internet, as defined by Technopedia, "is a globally connected network system facilitating worldwide communication and access to data resources through a vast collection of private, public, business, academic and government networks." (Technopedia, 2020). It is the gate point of the 4th industrial revolution. The internet is the Silicon Valley of human connection, communication, innovation, intelligence, and exploration. The internet facilitates our ever-growing ambition for learning and love for knowledge as a species; "humans tend by default to be inquisitive, curious, interested in learning things because this trait provides them with the best chance of surviving in the world" (Quora, 2014). This hasn’t changed as the internet is the global library of the world. So why is access to the internet not a basic human right?
                  <br><br>Here is my equation: The internet equals money. As much as the internet is a global library containing the knowledge and information of human civilization, the universe and its complexities, plant and animal life, it is also a financial cash cow that yields big money. "The Internet has proved to be a spawning ground for a large and growing number of "e-businesses" (including subsidiaries of traditional "brick-and-mortar" companies) that carry out most of their sales and services over the Internet." (Dennis, 2022). If money makes the world go round, then power is the engine that drives it—that’s a bold statement coming from me. Here’s what I mean. "The reason that money holds such a power over people is that it provides them with power – to do what they want to do, whatever that may be." (HR future, 2017). Part of the reason the internet is not accessible to all is that money is power, and no one in a neo-colonial or capitalist society wants to empower those they are exploiting. Furthermore, this is gatekeeping economic opportunities. "So those who do not have access to the internet cannot participate in this new kind of digital economy that is flourishing. This means that not only can they not buy or sell goods, but that they cannot "sell" their work; in common, they cannot work." (Kasapis, 2020). This is politically driven by those in power, and you can quote me on that.
                  </p>
                <p>Society</p>
                <p>The Cambridge Dictionary defines society as "a large group of people who live together in an organized manner, making decisions about how to do things and sharing the work that needs to be done." (Cambridge Dictionary, 2022). A gathering of people in one organized place can be considered a society, so Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter can be described as a digital society. "The notion of digital society reflects the results of the modern society in adopting and integrating information and communication technologies at home, work, education and recreation." (LIBRe, 2022). Participation in the digital society is virtual for the purposes of representation, as we know that societies construct patterns of behavior by deeming certain actions or concepts as acceptable or unacceptable. These patterns of behavior within a given society are known as societal norms. It is important that everyone is a part of the conversation and voices their concerns about the injustices of any society. In closing, "free internet access should be indispensable to all members of an organized society." (Kasapis, 2020). for the betterment of all who live, not just a select few.</p>
                <p>Design Justice</p>
                <p>According to Sasha Costanza-Chock, "Design justice" is an approach to design that is led by marginalized communities and that aims explicitly to challenge, rather than reproduce, structural inequalities. It has emerged from a growing community of designers in various fields who work closely with social movements and community-based organizations around the world." (Costanza-Chock, 2020). It aspires to equal treatment of all people in technology and information, regardless of skin color, ability, gender, age, personal circumstances, or societal context. It presents itself as a solution to white supremacist heteropatriarchy, ableism, capitalism, and settler colonialism through user interface and user experience design by deploying good user-centered design so that "We use design to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems" (Neil, 2021). Design Justice is one of the ways inequality and discrimination are being addressed and resolved within the global internet community.</p>

                <p>Stepping into this assignment, my initial goal was to take the feedback from assignment 1 and work on improving it for this assignment. The process started with the homepage. Assignment 1 didn’t have a homepage per se, it was a combination of the homepage and the blog posts. This was immediately addressed, as now assignment 2 has a homepage and a blog page.</p>
                <p>1.	"Text runs to/from extreme ends of the screen."
                  <br>2.	"Block and center with borders giving space to breath at bottom and edges."
                  <br>I have solved this by aligning the text at the center of the screen. Now the text is clearly visible for all to see. I have also created borders around the text with a colored background to give it contrast over the background image.
                  </p>
                  <p>3.	"You need to work on how you incorporate the text around the image to create visual unity."
                    <br>My solution to this was to have a background image for the website to give it a visually pleasing aesthetic. Furthermore, I have decreased the distance between image and caption to create a more fluid feel in how the users consume the information. The captions are centered around the image for easy readability.
                    </p>
                    <p>4.	"You should also be engaging with the reasons for your choices - colour, font, placement."
                      <br>I'm not quite sure how to explain my color choices, but let me try. I chose it because of its bright blue and purple coloring, as I did not want to go for a dark mood or tone. I wanted things to be bright and relaxing to the eye. I think settle aesthetics was what I was trying to achieve. The header and the footer are transparent and contribute to the theme I’m portraying. The header slightly camouflages with the background. The header is visible but does stand out. I could say the same for the footer, with its transparent whiteness. The text background image isn’t settle. It's meant to be seen because that's where I want my user to spend the majority of their time, as well as where I want my viewers' eyes to be.
                      <br>Font choice is influenced by the fact that "Times New Roman is appropriate for reading plain texts such as contracts and for that purpose, it uses space economically – nothing more, nothing less. Legibility and economy of space." (We agree, 2022).    
                      </p>
                      <p>5.	"links going out of your website should open in a new tab"
                        <br>I have solved this with the introduction of target="_blank" in the link codes.
                        </p>
                        <p>6.	"Get rid of unncessary divs - if you have a container element like <strong>article</strong> there is no need for a seperate <strong>div</strong> inside"
                          <br>I addressed this by removing any unnecessary divs. All or any divs have a styling purpose to them. Furthermore I have used the <strong>cite</strong> function for my reference lists as I was asked to do.
                          </p>
                          <p>7.	"You have <strong>foot</strong> tag in your index page which is not a valid HTML element."
                            <br>They are completely removed as they served no purpose anyway. Now the code is clearer and much more readable.
                            <br><br>Overall, I believe I have addressed the core issues of assignment 1 and have improved assignment 2 from a design, code, user interface, and user experience perspective.

                <p>The process of making this website has brought about an understanding of what being a web designer is. The multiple changes I made from the initial website that was first submitted have been astronomical, to say the least. I began this project with a solid light bluish/greenish background that was plain and a bit boring. My text was situated tightly on the right side of the web page. This is and was problematic visually and affected readability to a certain extent.</p>
                <p>Assignment 2 was me trying to address the issues of assignment 1, starting with text alignment. So then began the process of centering information, adding a more creative and "nicer" looking background. I separated the homepage from the blog posts, showing a clear header and footer so that they aren’t confused with each other, also separating them away from the content, and finally deployed javascript animation for the homepage.</p>
                <p>The exam is built on the foundations of Assignment 2, with just a few adjustments here and there, like in the blog post. I now have a speed scroller installed, so when the users don’t want to scroll all the way down to the exam blog posts, essay, and reflection, they can simply press this button and it will fast track them to the exam work. This is one of the ways I wanted to improve user interaction and user experience. There are also new Javascripts, but I speak about them more in the essay. As standard, new artwork has been incorporated as requested by the exam guidelines.</p>
                <p>Overall, I see my progress in web design as a primary sign of me learning and understanding the concepts and principles of coding and designing websites. I look at this experience with a smile and with a positive mindset. I can't wait to try this for my own individual work later. </p>

                  <p>What is JavaScript?</p>
                  <p>
                    According to Hack Reactor "JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user." (Reactor, 2021). JavaScript is a programming language used on computers by programmers to first communicate with the computer and then perform certain actions with the computer.
                  </p>
                  <p>What are JavaScript Libraries?</p>
                   <p>
                    Files that contain pre-written code meant to make the job of a developer/designer/programmer easy. JavaScript libraries solve this problem admirably, and there are dozens, if not hundreds, to choose from. Pre-written JavaScript code is included in the JavaScript libraries, which simplifies the completion of common and complex tasks. Common targets for JavaScript libraries include DOM manipulation, framework setup, and AJAX handling.

                    What did I do?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I used the JavaScript library Howler.js, which is a modern web audio library. It uses the Web Audio API by default and then falls back to HTML5 Audio. Working with audio in JavaScript is now simple and reliable across all platforms. So, whenever the user opens my website, audio plays. This is to add another layer to the user experience on the website and to facilitate a new way of consuming content.
